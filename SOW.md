# ESIP FUNding Friday Statement of Work
### Where Should I Put My Data? Supporting Researchers in Repository Discovery
### Amber Budden


### Purpose
This Statement of Work outlines the plan for use of the FUNding Friday ESIP Member award received at the 2020 ESIP Summer Meeting held remotely.


### Background 
Given increased requirements by funding agencies, institutions, and journals for research data products to be made openly available, and changing community perceptions regarding the importance of data sharing, researchers need to make informed decisions about where best to place their data. Selection of an appropriate data repository not only enables researchers to meet these requirements, but also impacts how discoverable, accessible and useable those data are. Despite the prevalence of institutional, generalist and domain data repositories, conference sessions dedicated to data preservation and repository function, and several catalogs and tools design to support users, this question of where to preserve research data products remains one of the most frequently asked.
A challenge remains in connecting researchers to the information and resources available to support them in discovering an appropriate data repository. This requires outreach designed for the research community, particularly ECRs faced with this question for the first time. We do not need to reinvent the resources; rather, we need to create awareness around them.


### Proposed activities
This work will build upon activities already underway by DataONE and include collaboration with partners across ESIP including AGU, ESS-DIVE, Arctic Data Center, CDL, EDI, GSA and NCEAS. We will 
- Review of the needs of, and challenges faced by, researchers in repository selection
- Explore mechanisms for repository selection information dissemination 
- Develop outreach materials designed for the research community
- Conduct a webinar on the topic within the DataONE Webinar series
- Contribute to the development of a game (currently underway) focused on data repository selection.
- Integrate with AGU on Data FAIR activities


### Deliverables
Beyond the deliverables identified as part of the proposed activities, this work will also be presented as part of the ESIP Winter meeting.


### Use of Funding
The award will be issued as a gift to DataONE at NCEAS (institutional home of Amber Budden) to support graphics and outreach design work, production of outreach materials, and other costs associated with the project. Amber Budden shall manage the funds through the NCEAS gift account
